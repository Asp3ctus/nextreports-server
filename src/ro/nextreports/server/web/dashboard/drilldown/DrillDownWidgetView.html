<!-- 
For drill down we want to have the "Up" link outside the scroll area 
So we make the panel without overflow and we put the overflow on the renderer

drillHeader is used inside WidgetWebPage.html to customize it when it is found inside an iframe
-->
<wicket:panel style="overflow: none !important;">	
    <div wicket:id="drillDown" class="align-left drillHeader"></div>
    <div wicket:id="renderer" class="drill-dragbox-content zoom"></div>    
</wicket:panel>
